# Sheriff

There is a sheriff around this part that wants to clean the ship up. They will be randomly assigned and will have one shot. If they are killed, their shot is wasted. If they do manage to get a shot off, that person will die. If they kill an Impostor, thats good and they get to keep playing. But they shoot a crewmate? The crew will revolt and kill them.

The Sheriff can kill someone during a meeting with `/sheriff kill playerName`
